# Map-Quiz
The Flag Quiz app tests your ability to correctly identify 10 flags from various countries and territories.
By default, the app presents a flag image and four country-name Buttons that you click to guess the answer,
one is correct and the others are randomly selected,nonduplicated incorrect answers. The app displays the
user’s progress throughout the quiz,showing the question number (out of 10) in a TextView above the current
flag image.The app also allows you to control the quiz difficulty by specifying whether to display two, four
, six or eight guess Buttons, and by choosing the world regions that should be included in the quiz.
These options are displayed differently, based on the device that’s running the app and the orientation of 
the device.This app also supports portrait orientation on any device, but landscape orientation only on tablets.
